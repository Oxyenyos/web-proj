@Cari - I have an iPad Air 2 and you can read up on my
[stylus recommendations here](https://alokprateek.in/faqs/stylus-recommendations/).
Pencil has good compatibility with older devices and does work with the Air.

I don't have first hand experience with the newer Pogo Connect, but it does
[support the older iPad Air](https://tenonedesign.com/connect.php#compatibility)
if you want pressure sensitive tips (something FiftyThree's Pencil does not
have).
