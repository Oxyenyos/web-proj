The answer that no one likes to hear is "*practice, practice, practice.*" I wish there was some magical shortcut for learning how to draw, but there isn't.

I learn something new every time I drag my stylus or finger across the iPad's screen. The best way to improve your craft is by putting in the time through observation and experimentation.

Drawing everyday certainly helped me advance my skills, but I still have a lot to learn.
